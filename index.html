            <h2>My Story</h2>
            <p>My name is Calista! I am 21 years old and am originally from Mahtomedi, MN. I live with my family of six and my two English Springer Spaniels. I love the outdoors and hiking as well as surfing on the boat in the summer!</p>
            <p>I am currently a senior at the University of Wisconsin- Eau Claire studying Marketing with a minor in Multi-Media Communications and Management! Although I came originally for nursing, I'm so glad I switched!</p>

            <img src="images/thumbnail_PSE Pic.jpg" alt="PSE">
            <p>Regarding extracurricular activities, I am apart of a business fraternity at Eau Claire called PSE. Through this club, students learn the fundamentals of marketing and sales. In my time in the club, I resided as Director of Public Relations where I was in charge of both promos and the website.</p>
            <p>When talking about previous jobs, I have experience in several fields. To start, I was an Administrative Assistant under my dad where I created spread sheets and documents to organize data for executive use. For my next job as a Customer Service Representative, I processed customer orders for transactions via phone. For my next job as a marketing intern, I modernized and managed social media content creation. For my last job as a restaurant hostess, I -Greeted on average 150+ customers per day and escorted them to their table
